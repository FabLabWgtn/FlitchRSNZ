A foyer seating project by Wendy Neale and Stuart Foster.
Inspired by the forms of stacked wood, designers Stuart Foster and Wendy Neale created seating for the foyer of the new Royal Society of New Zealand building in Wellington. The seating complements the buildingâ€™s colours with a combination of engineered timber from Scion and plantation-grown timbers.
